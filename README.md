# nytreact
React.js application that scrapes NYT articles, allows users to search for and save articles from the New York Times Article Search API.

## Installation
After cloning, run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.

## Development
If you'd like to tinker with the application, launch it on a local development server using the command "yarn start."
Note: the API server will listen on 3001, and the development server will be on PORT 3000, so if you have any CORS issues, make sure the proxy settings are correct in the client-level package.json file.
